BONUS POINTS
Whilst not essential, we will be very pleased to see you take the challenge further by:
i.
Using the data provided to its full potential by taking advantage of fields like colour for subjects.
ii. Making the GUI as appealing and responsive as possible.
iii. Storing the data locally and refresh from the server as requested, taking advantage of the
HTTP headers to avoid downloads of non-stale data.
iv. Unit testing your code.
